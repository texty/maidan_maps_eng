        <p id="one">On the 63-th day of the protest the Yanukovych government started killing Ukrainians, mostly with
            firearms.</p>
        <p>On January 22 Ukraine celebrates the Unity Day, a celebration of consolidating different historical regions
            into one state. In the early hours of the festive day three unarmed protesters got fatal gunshot wounds -
            <span><b>Serhiy NIHOYAN</b></span> from Dnipropetrovsk oblast, <b><span>Mykhaylo ZHYZNEVSKYY</span></b> (a
            Belarusian emigrant) from Kyiv oblast and <b><span>Roman SENYK </span></b> from Halychyna.</p>
        <p>The mass murder on the Kyiv streets would break out in 27 days.</p>
        <p>This is a story about the <b>people who were killed during the protests in the centre of Kyiv during February
            18-20, 2014.</b> No matter on which side of the barricades they parted with life.
        </p>
        <p>It should be emphasized that our material is <b>neither an investigation nor an attempt to deliver a judgment
            before the completion of the judicial proceedings.</b></p>
        <p>First we should arrange all available information about the circumstances of death of those people: <b>who,
            when, where, and how got a fatal wound?</b></p>
        <p>To do this, we turned to <b>three groups of sources:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>- conclusions of the investigation team of the General Prosecutor’s Office,</li>
            <li>- documentary videos,</li>
            <li>- online reports.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But the DATA available as of the beginning of March 2017 DO NOT PROVIDE THE ENTIRE COMPREHENSIVE information.
            So we had to make assumptions, especially regarding the deaths on February 18-19. This task is still very
            far from completion.</p>
        <p><b>Special Investigation Department of the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine will need another several
            months, if not years, to find out all the details of the tragic events that occurred during the final days
            of mass protests. We will also assist in search, updating this project with every fact found. We would
            appreciate any help in establishing the truth.</b></p>


        <h2 id="two" data-timestamp="18 08:00" data-episode="I">І. February 18. Demonstration and clashes in the
            government quarter</h2>
        <p>The day before the cessation of actions was established. The protesters <b>leave the premises of Kyiv City
            Council and partially deblock Hrushevskoho street</b>, opening a way through the rows of barricades. Until
            February 18 all large-scale violence episodes during the street protests in Kyiv occurred on these
            barricades.</p>
        <p>The political opposition hopes that a part of the Party of Regions faction would support the idea to limit
            the power of Yanukovych by reinstatement of the Constitution of 2004.</p>
        <p>For the pressure on Parliament in the morning of <b>February 18, 2014 the «peaceful offensive» goes to the
            Verkhovna Rada.</b></p>
        <p>The march participants are far from being in peaceful mood - <b>three months have passed since the beginning
            of the protests</b>, and the government still has not responded to any demand of Maidan.</p>
        <p>The events of that day are still the least investigated. This is especially true concerning the geography of
            violence in the government quarter — the data available today contain no specific addresses, but only the
            «Mariyinskyi park» or «Instytutska street.» </p>
        <p>In such cases we have determined the <b>APPROXIMATE PLACE of getting fatal wounds</b> with appropriate
            comments in the description. We based our research on the general chronology of clashes, time of death
            (finding of a body) and nature of injuries.</p>
        <p><b>Event times</b> are <b>approximate.</b></p>

        <h3><b>PROTESTERS GO TO VERKHOVNA RADA. The «Berkut» gets combat ammunition</b></h3>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 08:00">08:00</span>
        <p id="three">At Maidan columns of demonstrators are formed. They are defended by the fighters of the
            Self-Defense («Samooborona») having protective gear (helmets, body armor, shields) and sticks to withstand a
            possible attack of security forces.</p>
        <p>At the same time at Parkova drive since 8 a.m. <b>the Antimaidan mass meeting participants get off the
            buses</b>. The people brought here are mostly the public sector employees, but there are also some strong
            athletes.</p>
        <p>Verkhovna Rada and a part of the Mariyinskyi park is surrounded by four lines of Internal Troops and the
            «Berkut».</p>
        <p>The day before some <b>«Berkut» soldiers get combat ammunition instead of non-letal ones.</b> This fact is
            proved by the court <a
                    href="https://texty.org.ua/pg/news/textynewseditor/read/71373/Jeksberkutivec_dla_rozstrilu_Majdanu_pidvozyly_patrony_zi">testimony</a>
            by a soldier of Kharkiv «Berkut» Squadron, Shapovalov. The same kind of ammunition will be provided again on
            February 18 in the evening near Zhovtnevyy Palalce.</p>
        <p>The bullets with lead canister shot are given without restriction and not recorded in any documents. A police
            officer who organized the issuance of these bullets to the personnel deliberately aimed to kill people.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 09:30">09:30</span>
        <p><b>A column of protesters marches</b> through Instytutska and Kriposnyy lane to Hrushevskoho <b>street</b>.
            They drive away the KamAZ trucks which were blocking the way. <b>Clashes are minimal</b>. Some protesters
            are trying to break through the security lines to Verkhovna Rada.</p>
        <p>In the office of the Verkhovna Rada Speaker Oleksandr Rybak <b>unsuccessful negotiations continue</b> on
            voting concerning the law on the Constitution 2004.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 10:10">10:10</span>
        <p id="four">At the intersection of Instytutska and Sadova street, the police with «Fort» guns started maiming
            people shooting traumatic ammunition and throwing concussion grenades directly into the crowd. </p>
        <p>Demonstrators set on fire the KamAZ trucks blocking Sadova. Then some soldiers from Internal Troops surrender
            to their opponents. The Self-Defense protects them from the angry crowd. Clashes continue until
            lunchtime.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 10:30">10:30</span>
        <p>There are several thousands of protesters gathered in Mariyinskyi park. They <b>surround Antimaidan from
            three sides</b>, from Hrushevskoho to the Dnipro slopes, fulfilling a plan to block Verkhovna Rada -- until
            the «Regions» and the Communists join the voting for the Constitution-2004.</p>
        <p><b>The most efficient Self-Defense hundreds</b> are concentrated there. First they have been leading the
            march, and now they are patrolling the perimeter — <b>going to the corners of the park farthest from
                Hrushevskoho.</b></p>

        <h3><b>«ENHANCED HUMANITARIAN AID». Russian grenades for the «Berkut»</b></h3>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 10:52">10:52</span>
        <p id="five">A column of security officials moved from Rada to Shovkovychna. They carried green boxes with some
            ammunition. Obviously, these were Russian "enhanced special means", significantly more powerful than their
            Ukrainian analogues.</p>
        <p>Over two months of confrontation the «Berkut» used so many grenades that the MIA had to procure more from
            Russia, spending the <b>total amount of UAH 1.2 million.</b></p>
        <p>On the January 21, An-12 aircraft which departed from a military airfield near Moscow landed in the Zhulyany
            airport. According to the delivery note from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs it carried more than
            <b>6,000 units of special means:</b> concussion grenades "Fakel-S", "Zarya-2" and «Plamya-M", aerosol and
            smoke grenades, irritating grenades "RGR" - ordinary and the «enhanced» ones.</p>
        <img src="img/grenades.png" class="img-responsive" alt="grenades">
        <p>But this was not enough, as MIA extensively used the new grenades during clashes on Hrushevskoho. On January
            24 An-12 makes another flight to Moscow. The second batch of special means - <b>more than 7,300 units</b> -
            lands in Gostomel.</p>
        <p>In accompanying documents <b>these items were listed as the «humanitarian aid.»</b></p>
        <p>New grenades are <b>authorized for use by the police without any examination</b> by the Ministry of Health,
            although their sound and effect is much more powerful than of those the soldiers of the «Berkut» used on
            November 30 and December 1. </p>
        <p>The security officers further enhance the already enhanced effect of special means, taping improvised
            «fragmentation elements» - fastening nails, screws or other small metal objects - to the grenades.</p>

        <h3>SECURITY FORCES USE COMBAT BULLETS. Arson of the Party of Regions’ office</h3>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 11:00">11:00</span>
        <p id="six"><b>Clashes near Verkhovna Rada</b> begin. Massive explosions of concussion grenades are evidenced.
        </p>
        <p>According to the Head of the Special Investigation Department of the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine
            Sergiy Horbatyuk, <b>from 11 o'clock that day combat weapons were again used on the streets of Kyiv.</b></p>
        <p>Only demonstrators got the first gunshot wounds. No security officers were found among those injured at that
            time.</p>
        <p>While peaceful march continued, the «Berkut» soldiers were hiding in the yards. Some of them accessed the
            roofs. They targetedly fired their "Forts". They threw down concussion grenades directly amid the crowds of
            people.</p>

        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 11:20">11:20</span>
        <p>The «Berkut» soldiers who tried to attack Shovkovychna were chased away with stones. The majority of people
            doing it were not the trained fighters of the Self-Defense, but mostly the ordinary «civilians». However,
            they braced up a fierce resistance, even though a month ago they considered similar actions of «extremists»
            on Hrushevskoho a provocation.</p>
        <p>One of Maidan leaders <b>led some part of protesters from Instytutska to the central office of the Party of
            Regions</b> (Lypska street, 10). </p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 11:25">~11:25</span>
        <p>Having broken the door, the protesters kicked the employees out of the office and seized the Party documents.
            Subsequently, these documents would help investigate the crimes of the regime. The ground floor and the
            basement of the house were set on fire from the «Molotov cocktail».</p>
        <p>Apparently, around that time the 65-year-old man from Kyiv, <b><span>Volodymyr ZAKHAROV</span></b> died in
            the fire. He worked as an IT support specialist in the building where the Party of Regions office was
            located. His daughter-in-law Victoria <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/euromaidanbankovavictims/posts/601383306606035"
                    target="_blank">cited</a> the official information from physicians: «The autopsy showed no signs of
            blows or violence, he just died of suffocation ...»</p>
        <p>The investigation confirmed that the body of the deceased had no signs of violent death. Zakharov suffocated
            due to carbon monoxide concentration, staying for too long in the smoky room to save at least some hardware
            from the workplaces of the office workers.</p>
        <p><b>Should this victim be among the Hundred of Heaven?</b> Wikipedia includes him and the memorial photo of
            Zakharov can be found at the Instytutska. He remained in office when all others fled. He fell another victim
            of the grandiose and tragic events, and also deserves being remembered.</p>
        <p>The death of Zakharov is connected with the violent events, but is not actually a homicide, unlike most of
            the deaths described here.</p>

        <h3>MARIYINSKYI PARK. Self-Defense against Antimaidan</h3>
        <p id="seven"> Meanwhile, in the Mariyinskyi park Antimaidan hurls stones at the Self-Defense from behind the
            police line.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:700px;">Here in the Antimaidan camp the battle groups are formed from the «Titushky»
            (mercenary thugs) (and possibly other supporters of Yanukovych). They obtain shields with the inscription
            "Police", Soviet-style iron helmets, sticks and pipes.</p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>The «Titushky» equipped like the Self-Defense and acting in close coordination with the «Berkut» are a know-how of the regime.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>Around <b>noon real street battles</b> break out. The Self-Defense manages to push Internal Troops back several dozens of meters into the Antimaidan camp. Internal troops leave behind them fence shields which protesters are trying to use for defense perimeter.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>Members of Parliament from the Party of Regions start fleeing from the session room. The number of injured is growing rapidly. Stones, «Molotovs» and Russian concussion grenades «enhanced» with tape and nails are hurled at protesters. One of the commanders of the Self-Defense has his hand torn off with such a grenade.</span>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p id="eight">Demonstrators <b>organize a hospital</b> for the wounded in the <b>House of Officers</b> (on the
            corner of Hrushevskoho and Kriposnyy lane).</p>
        <p>During this time <b>Antimaidan is preparing for a counterattack.</b> To help the fighters distinguish «their»
            people from similarly-equipped Self-Defense they use the identification marks - white and red armbands.
            These colours can hardly have any ideological meaning, the tape is simply the cut pieces of plastic signal
            tape which police typically uses to enclose a crime scene. The «committed» fighters with fascism from the
            opposition also wear St.George’s Ribbon.</p>
        <p>Yanukovych's supporters do not use the colors of the national flag of Ukraine at all, while the clothes of
            protesters is so richly decorated with them.</p>
        <p>Hiding behind the lines of the Internal Troops, Antimaidan members wearing helmets and using sticks pluck
            stones out of the pedestrian pavements and bring them closer to a possible place of clashes. The «Supporters
            of current President" are divided into groups, managed by coordinators who tell them what to do.</p>
        <p>From the stage of Antimaidan Soviet war songs are played very loudly all the time and calls are heard to

        <p>MIA does not add that the 12 mm gauge is standard for smoothbore guns. Their cartridges may use many types of

        <p>On several videos a person with a weapon, apparently a smooth-bore shotgun, briefly appeared <b>within the
            protesters’ ranks.</b> A group of protesters is going up Instytutska Street from Maidan to Hotel Ukraina
            along the right pedestrian passway, and among them a tall bulky young man in a Soviet-style steel helmet and
            camouflage jacket (tiger-striped pattern, bluish «Berkut» hues) carried a hunting rifle.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:21">09:21:35</span>
        <p id="sixty-five">Waiting for a few seconds in a small greenery area near Hotel Ukraina the protesters continue
            climbing up Instytutska Street. Four of them carry shields, the fifth — a gun. They already went past the
            stairway to a hotel. Not more than 100 meters is left to the upper exit from the already closed Khreschatyk
            metro station.</p>
        <p>Based on the available videos, <b>till 9:22</b> all black uniform gunners with yellow armbands already went
            behind a half-ruined barricade opposite the exit from the metro to Instytutska Street (crossing with
            Olhynska Street). The investigation representatives call it «a snow barricade». </p>
        <p>This is the same protesters-made fortification from show bags with a narrow pass where the stampede occurred
            about 16:00 on February 18, after which two bodies were found on the barricade with the cause of death
            registered as «heart failure». </p>
        <p>This day and a half seemed like an eternity.</p>
        <p>The center of the barricade is disassembled by the police to allow vehicles to pass. At the right side
            several meters up to the entrance to the metro were preserved. From the left side much more of the
            fortifications were left, albeit as chaotic debris of the snow, dirt, soot, half-charred planks, tires, rugs
            etc. </p>
        <p>The cameras filming the crossroads of the Instytutska-Olhynska from the National Bank side allow us to see
            what is going on behind the barricade. People in black uniforms with yellow armbands line up along the snow
            fortification like at a firing position. </p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:21">09:21:55</span>
        <p>Not more that 100 meters are left to the upper exit from Khreschatyk station when the vanguard group of 5
            protesters stops. They look around hiding behind the row of shields set up on the pavement. Four people with
            shields are in the upper row, the fifth one, with a hunting gun, is behind them. </p>
        <p><b><span>Ihor DMYTRIV</span> (aged 30)</b> from Subcarpathian region, holds the smallest shield, 100 per 59
            cm, according to the standard for «special equipment — shock-proof aluminum shield «Fort-ShchPA». Other
            shield bearers have self-made equipment of plied wood.</p>
        <p>Dmytriv was a lawyer. Recently he built a house in the country. He arrived to Maidan on February 19, in the
            morning. He took a taxi not to get late for a bus to Kyiv.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:21:59</span>
        <p id="sixty-six">A 7.62 mm bullet easily pierced the aluminum and hit Dmytro in the chest. The impact is so
            strong that it wrenched a holed-through shield from his hand. The bullet, perforating the lungs, threw Ihor
            two meters back, under a lightbox near the pavement. The wounded man turns to his side and grabs at the
            wound.</p>
        <p>His brothers-in-arms seemingly fail to understand what happened. They do not turn around. They put the
            shields close and look forward. Behind them Ihor is lying on his side, bending and unbending knees.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:07</span>
        <p>An armed man in the blue camouflage turns back to the wounded man. Suddenly he yanks his leg, like from a
            burn (another bullet may have hit nearly) and bolts back from a crouch start.</p>
        <p>Lying on his side, Dmytriv shoves off the pavement, as if trying to make a step towards the row where he was
            standing a few seconds ago. But this move only makes the body turn around on a slippery surface. One more
            tug towards the comrades, and he crouches down on the pavement in exhaustion.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:24</span>
        <p>«The hunter» runs to Hotel Ukraina and slows down to striding on a path along the hotel wall. This path is
            separated from Instytutska Street by a greenery spot from where he started his attack a couple of minutes
            ago.</p>
        <p>At this moment «the hunter» passes by <b><span>Andriy DYGDALOVYCH</span> (aged 40)</b>, a construction
            specialist from Lviv district. Andriy follows a parallel line, by a pavement along Instytutska Street, in
            the opposite direction, towards the bullets. </p>
        <p>Dygdalovych came to Kyiv three months ago. He arrived here to stand not for association with the EU, but
            rather for human dignity: «I want to tell the government that we won’t tolerate battering of our kids». He
            was organizing the security in the Maidan headquarters, contributing to the Self-Defense. </p>
        <p>During all this period Dygdalovych had been at home twice, on Christmas and after getting injured at
            Hrushevskoho street. A traumatic missile hit him in the eye, destroying the sight by 80%. Andriy stayed in a
            Lviv hospital only a couple of days and returned to Kyiv, to his «Afghan Hundred».</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:32</span>
        <p>The wounded Ihor Dmytriv is lying in the same position — on his side, with bent legs and his head on the
            ground. He is shivering, pressing his hand against the wound. The brothers-in-arms finally pay attention to
            his condition. </p>
        <p>Having got to the passage leading from Hotel Ukraina to the Instytutska Street, «the hunter» in blue
            camouflage slows down to usual walking speed. He firmly grabs at his rifle. At the pavement he turns left,
            to the descent leading to Maidan. </p>
        <p>Andriy Dygdalovych continues walking up the street. He can be easily recognized by his athletic stature and
            almost 2 meters’ height. A huge wooden shield in his hands looks like a toy. His confident stare is that of
            a worldly-wise man used to make resolutions of his own and fulfill them.</p>
        <p>His only weapons are a self-made shield («plywood») and an armored vest («tin vest»).</p>
        <p>During the storm of December 11 Dygdalovych organized the defense. He stood in the first rank and was
            captured by the police during clashes. One of the police officers, who saw his cape with the words «Afghan
            veterans stand together with people» protected him from getting lynched.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:39</span>
        <p>40 seconds passed since Ihor Dmytriv was shot. He does not move anymore, only the jacket on his back pouts
            and sags as he is struggling for breath.</p>
        <p>His comrades seem to have no clue what happened, or they just are disoriented. Who would have known anything
            about Kalashnikov wounds and tactical medicine back then?</p>
        <p>Andriy Dygdalovych covers the last several meters running.</p>
        <p>He is actually too young to have been an Afghan war veteran. He joined the veteran hundred because he
            considered that there he would be able to act in the most efficient way. The Afghan war veterans accepted
            him.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:42</span>
        <p>Andriy takes a decision in a few seconds. Glimpsing at the wounded Ihor, he turns around and waves his hand
            to call others. Another person with a self-made shield, big enough to be used as a stretcher, responds and
            starts running up the street.</p>
        <p id="sixty-seven" style="margin-bottom:700px;">For his actions on December 11 Dygdalovych was presented for an
            award, honorable sign of the headquarters «For the Defense of Maidan». The solemn awarding was planned for
            the morning of February 20.</p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>«Do not disappear, - the friends reminded Andriy two hours before, when he entered the headquarters tent after the night duty. — Your award ceremony is soon». «Am I a hero? — Dygdalovych answered then. «I did not deserve it. But I will deserve it now». He stood up and went out.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>And here he is, on the Instytutska Street, organizing the evacuation of the wounded Ihor Dmytriv. He makes energetic gestures, giving some instructions to the three shield bearers.</span>

        <p>Pyatkovskyy would die at home in 3 years and 2 days, on February 22, 2017. A dozen and a half people would

            Hundred of Heaven) song did not play at the ceremony.</p>

        <p>The negotiations with the participation of Yanukovych, the opposition, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of
            France, Germany and Russia continue all night. The President threatens to drown Maidan in blood, while
            packing things in his residence. </p>

        <p>Yanukovych appears in Mezhygirya for the last time to control the handling of things loaded into cars during

        <p>In Kharkiv the «Separatist Congress» is opened with a pompous ceremony. They expect to host a programmatic
            speech by Yanukovych, but the President fails to show up. He flees.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="21 17:00">17:00</span>
        <p>Verkhovna Rada by 328 votes supported the resolution on appointment for May 25 of the extraordinary elections
            of the President of Ukraine in connection with the fact that Yanukovych «withdrew from the fulfillment of
            his constitutional duties».</p>

        <p>In a year and a half Yanukovych would say he should command more people killed on Maidan: «My key mistake is
            that I did not dare to sign an order and announce the deployment of troops and martial law in Ukraine».</p>
        <p>15 thousand of law enforcement officers took part in the events around Maidan, while only about a dozen
            provided more or less reliable evidence. They are not afraid of journalists or the court. They are afraid of
            their chiefs. If the key MIA staff makes a clear statement «We will employ only those who do not conceal
            crimes», it would help to increase the number of investigations», says officer Horbatiuk, chief of the
            investigation of crimes during the Revolution of Dignity. </p>
        <p>P.S. 35 persons are condemned in cases regarding the crimes against Maidan activists, 152 persons are under
            trial, about 190 are under pre-trial investigation, according to the press secretary of the Prosecutor
            General. Some of the persons suspected of mass shootings are hiding on the territory of Russia.</p>
