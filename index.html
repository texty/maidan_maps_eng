        <p id="one">On the 63-th day of the protest the Yanukovych government started killing Ukrainians, mostly with firearms.</p>
        <p>On January 22 Ukraine celebrates the Unity Day, a celebration of consolidating different historical regions into one state. In the early hours of the festive day three unarmed protesters got fatal gunshot wounds - <span><b>Serhiy NIHOYAN</b></span> from Dnipropetrovsk oblast, <b><span>Mykhaylo ZHYZNEVSKYY</span></b> (a Belarusian emigrant) from Kyiv oblast and <b><span>Roman SENYK </span></b> from Halychyna.</p>
        <p>The mass murder on the Kyiv streets would break out in 27 days.</p>
        <p>This is a story about the <b>people who were killed during the protests in the centre of Kyiv during February 18-20, 2014.</b> No matter on which side of the barricades they parted with life.
        </p>
        <p>It should be emphasized that our material is <b>neither an investigation nor an attempt to deliver a judgment before the completion of the judicial proceedings.</b></p>
        <p>First we should arrange all available information about the circumstances of death of those people: <b>who, when, where, and how got a fatal wound?</b></p>
        <p>To do this, we turned to <b>three groups of sources:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>- conclusions of the investigation team of the General Prosecutor’s Office,</li>
            <li>- documentary videos, </li>
            <li>- online reports.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>But the DATA available as of the beginning of March 2017 DO NOT PROVIDE THE ENTIRE COMPREHENSIVE information. So we had to make assumptions, especially regarding the deaths on February 18-19. This task is still very far from completion.</p>
        <p><b>Special Investigation Department of the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine will need another several months, if not years, to find out all the details of the tragic events that occurred during the final days of mass protests. We will also assist in search, updating this project with every fact found. We would appreciate any help in establishing the truth.</b></p>


        <h2 id="two" data-timestamp="18 08:00" data-episode="I">І.  February 18.  Demonstration and clashes in the government quarter</h2>
        <p>The day before the cessation of actions was established. The protesters <b>leave the premises of Kyiv City Council and partially deblock Hrushevskoho street</b>, opening a way through the rows of barricades. Until February 18 all large-scale violence episodes during the street protests in Kyiv occurred on these barricades.</p>
        <p>The political opposition hopes that a part of the Party of Regions faction would support the idea to limit the power of Yanukovych by reinstatement of the Constitution of 2004.</p>
        <p>For the pressure on Parliament in the morning of <b>February 18, 2014 the «peaceful offensive» goes to the Verkhovna Rada.</b> </p>
        <p>The march participants are far from being in peaceful mood - <b>three months have passed since the beginning of the protests</b>, and the government still has not responded to any demand of Maidan.</p>
        <p>The events of that day are still the least investigated. This is especially true concerning the geography of violence in the government quarter —  the data available today contain no specific addresses, but only the «Mariyinskyi park» or «Instytutska street.» </p>
        <p>In such cases we have determined the <b>APPROXIMATE PLACE of getting fatal wounds</b> with appropriate comments in the description. We based our research on the general chronology of clashes, time of death (finding of a body) and nature of injuries.</p>
        <p><b>Event times</b> are <b>approximate.</b></p>

        <h3><b>PROTESTERS GO TO VERKHOVNA RADA. The «Berkut» gets combat ammunition</b></h3>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 08:00">08:00</span> <p id="three">At Maidan columns of demonstrators are formed. They are defended by the fighters of the Self-Defense («Samooborona») having protective gear (helmets, body armor, shields) and sticks to withstand a possible attack of security forces.</p>
        <p>At the same time at Parkova drive since 8 a.m.  <b>the Antimaidan mass meeting participants  get off the buses</b>. The people brought here are mostly the public sector employees, but there are also some strong athletes.</p>
        <p>Verkhovna Rada and a part of the Mariyinskyi park is surrounded by four lines of Internal Troops and the «Berkut».</p>
        <p>The day before some <b>«Berkut» soldiers get combat ammunition instead of non-letal ones.</b>  This fact is proved by the court <a href="http://texty.org.ua/pg/news/textynewseditor/read/71373/Jeksberkutivec_dla_rozstrilu_Majdanu_pidvozyly_patrony_zi">testimony</a> by a soldier of Kharkiv «Berkut» Squadron,  Shapovalov.  The same kind of ammunition will be provided again on February 18 in the evening near Zhovtnevyy Palalce.</p>
        <p>The bullets with lead canister shot are given without restriction and not recorded in any documents. A police officer who organized the issuance of these bullets to the personnel deliberately aimed to kill people.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 09:30">09:30</span><p><b>A column of protesters marches</b> through Instytutska and Kriposnyy lane to Hrushevskoho <b>street</b>. They drive away the KamAZ trucks which were blocking the way. <b>Clashes are minimal</b>. Some protesters are trying to break through the security lines to Verkhovna Rada.</p>
        <p>In the office of the Verkhovna Rada Speaker Oleksandr Rybak <b>unsuccessful negotiations continue</b> on voting concerning the law on the Constitution 2004.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 10:10">10:10</span><p id="four">At the intersection of Instytutska and Sadova street, the police with «Fort» guns started maiming people shooting traumatic ammunition and throwing concussion grenades directly into the crowd. </p>
        <p>Demonstrators set on fire the KamAZ trucks blocking Sadova. Then some soldiers from Internal Troops surrender to their opponents. The Self-Defense protects them from the angry crowd. Clashes continue until lunchtime.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 10:30">10:30</span><p>There are several thousands of protesters gathered in Mariyinskyi park. They <b>surround Antimaidan from three sides</b>, from Hrushevskoho to the Dnipro slopes, fulfilling a plan to block Verkhovna Rada -- until the «Regions» and the Communists join the voting for the Constitution-2004.</p>
        <p><b>The most efficient Self-Defense hundreds</b> are concentrated there. First they have been leading the march, and now they are patrolling the perimeter — <b>going to the corners of the park farthest from Hrushevskoho.</b></p>

        <h3><b>«ENHANCED HUMANITARIAN AID». Russian grenades for the «Berkut»</b></h3>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 10:52">10:52</span><p id="five">A column of security officials moved from Rada to Shovkovychna. They carried green boxes with some ammunition. Obviously, these were Russian "enhanced special means", significantly more powerful than their Ukrainian analogues.</p>
        <p>Over two months of confrontation the «Berkut» used so many grenades that the MIA had to procure more from Russia, spending the <b>total amount of UAH 1.2 million.</b></p>
        <p>On the January 21, An-12 aircraft which departed from a military airfield near Moscow landed in the Zhulyany airport. According to the delivery note from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs it carried more than <b>6,000 units of special means:</b> concussion grenades "Fakel-S", "Zarya-2" and «Plamya-M", aerosol and smoke grenades, irritating grenades "RGR" - ordinary and the «enhanced» ones.</p>
        <img src="img/grenades.png" class="img-responsive" alt="grenades">
        <p>But this was not enough, as MIA extensively used the new grenades during clashes on Hrushevskoho. On January 24 An-12 makes another flight to Moscow. The second batch of special means - <b>more than 7,300 units</b> - lands in Gostomel.</p>
        <p>In accompanying documents <b>these items were listed as the «humanitarian aid.»</b></p>
        <p>New grenades are <b>authorized for use by the police without any examination</b> by the Ministry of Health, although their sound and effect is much more powerful than of those the soldiers of the «Berkut» used on November 30 and December 1.  </p>
        <p>The security officers further enhance the already enhanced effect of special means, taping improvised «fragmentation elements» - fastening nails, screws or other small metal objects - to the grenades.</p>

        <h3>SECURITY FORCES USE COMBAT BULLETS. Arson of the Party of Regions’ office</h3>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 11:00">11:00</span><p id="six"><b>Clashes near Verkhovna Rada</b> begin. Massive explosions of concussion grenades are evidenced.</p>
        <p>According to the Head of the Special Investigation Department of the General Prosecutor’s Office of Ukraine Sergiy Horbatyuk, <b>from 11 o'clock that day combat weapons were again used on the streets of Kyiv.</b></p>
        <p>Only demonstrators got the first gunshot wounds. No security officers were found among those injured at that time.</p>
        <p>While peaceful march continued, the «Berkut» soldiers were hiding in the yards. Some of them accessed the roofs. They targetedly fired their "Forts". They threw down concussion grenades directly amid the crowds of people.</p>

        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 11:20">11:20</span><p>The «Berkut» soldiers who tried to attack Shovkovychna were chased away with stones. The majority of people doing it were not the trained fighters of the Self-Defense, but mostly the ordinary «civilians». However, they braced up a fierce resistance, even though a month ago they considered similar actions of «extremists» on Hrushevskoho a provocation.</p>
        <p>One of Maidan leaders <b>led some part of protesters from Instytutska to the central office of the Party of Regions</b> (Lypska street, 10). </p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 11:25">~11:25</span><p>Having broken the door, the protesters kicked the employees out of the office and seized the Party documents. Subsequently, these documents would help investigate the crimes of the regime. The ground floor and the basement of the house were set on fire from the «Molotov cocktail».</p>
        <p>Apparently, around that time the 65-year-old man from Kyiv, <b><span>Volodymyr ZAKHAROV</span></b> died in the fire. He worked as an IT support specialist in the building where the Party of Regions office was located. His daughter-in-law Victoria <a href="https://www.facebook.com/euromaidanbankovavictims/posts/601383306606035" target="_blank">cited</a> the official information from physicians: «The autopsy showed no signs of blows or violence, he just died of suffocation ...»</p>
        <p>The investigation confirmed that the body of the deceased had no signs of violent death. Zakharov suffocated due to carbon monoxide concentration, staying for too long in the smoky room to save at least some hardware from the workplaces of the office workers.</p>
        <p><b>Should this victim be among the Hundred of Heaven?</b> Wikipedia includes him and the memorial photo of Zakharov can be found at the Instytutska. He remained in office when all others fled. He fell another victim of the grandiose and tragic events, and also deserves being remembered.</p>
        <p>The death of Zakharov is connected with the violent events, but is not actually a homicide, unlike most of the deaths described here.</p>

        <h3>MARIYINSKYI PARK. Self-Defense against Antimaidan</h3>
        <p id="seven"> Meanwhile, in the Mariyinskyi park Antimaidan hurls stones at the Self-Defense  from behind the police line.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:700px;">Here in the Antimaidan camp the battle groups are formed from the «Titushky» (mercenary thugs) (and possibly other supporters of Yanukovych). They obtain shields with the inscription "Police", Soviet-style iron helmets, sticks and pipes.</p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>The «Titushky» equipped like the Self-Defense and acting in close coordination with the «Berkut» are a know-how of the regime.</span></p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>Around <b>noon real street battles</b> break out. The Self-Defense manages to push Internal Troops back several dozens of meters into the Antimaidan camp. Internal troops leave behind them fence shields which protesters are trying to use for defense perimeter.</span></p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>Members of Parliament from the Party of Regions start fleeing from the session room. The number of injured is growing rapidly. Stones, «Molotovs» and Russian concussion grenades «enhanced» with tape and nails are hurled at protesters. One of the commanders of the Self-Defense has his hand torn off with such a grenade.</span></p>
        <p></p>
        <p id="eight">Demonstrators <b>organize a hospital</b> for the wounded in the <b>House of Officers</b> (on the corner of Hrushevskoho and Kriposnyy lane).</p>
        <p>During this time <b>Antimaidan is preparing for a counterattack.</b> To help the fighters distinguish «their» people from similarly-equipped Self-Defense they use the identification marks - white and red armbands. These colours can hardly have any ideological meaning, the tape is simply the cut pieces of plastic signal tape which police typically uses to enclose a crime scene. The «committed» fighters with fascism from the opposition also wear St.George’s Ribbon.</p>
        <p>Yanukovych's supporters do not use the colors of the national flag of Ukraine at all, while the clothes of protesters is so richly decorated with them.</p>
        <p>Hiding behind the lines of the Internal Troops,  Antimaidan members wearing helmets and using sticks pluck stones out of the pedestrian pavements and bring them closer to a possible place of clashes. The «Supporters of current President" are divided into groups, managed by coordinators who tell them what to do.</p>
        <p>From the stage of Antimaidan Soviet war songs are played very loudly all the time and calls are heard to destroy the monsters-Nazis.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 13:00">13:00</span><p id="nine">Around <b>13:00</b> the members of «Oplot» Kharkiv organization get in the rear of protesters by swooping around Hrushevskoho  from the Arsenal factory   This organization later start fighting on the Russian side in Donbas. <b>The Self-Defense counterattacks and chases away Oplot members.</b> The "prisoners" have burst packets with nails fastened to them and traumatic weapons.</p>
        <p>The situation in Mariyinka is inactive. An ambulance is called for the speaker of Verkhovna Rada Rybak allegedly because of heart problems. The opposition manages to register a draft of resolution concerning voting for the Constitution of 2004. However, no one is left to vote. </p>
        <p>In the early <b>1.p.m.</b> fifty soldiers of the «Berkut» <b>attack from Orlyka street</b> to get back the office. At the forefront the security officers with pump action guns are marching. They are followed by the Titushky with iron pipes.</p>
        <p>ПAfter a brief confrontation the office of the Party of Regions gets under the control of the police. Protesters retreat to the intersection of Lypska and Instytutska.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 13:20">13:20</span><p>Another attack on the corner of Shovkovychna and Instytutska. The <b>«Berkut» goes in a parade fashion</b>, firing their «Forts». Reporter Anastasia Bereza cannot find proper words to describe it. She repeats the most shocking detail twice: «They shoot right into the crowd.» Each shot is accurate. Those who fall or stay back are violently beaten with clubs.</p>
        <p>Around the same time a co-owner of the corporation «Industrial Union of Donbass» <b>Serhiy Taruta calls Oleksandr Yanukovych</b>. The latter is the eldest son of the President - the leader of the Donetsk «Young team» Viktor Yanukovych trusts him the most, delegating him more and more authority since 2012.</p>
        <p>Taruta asks his Donetsk counterpart to convince his father about the inadmissibility of the force  option.»Perhaps [Maidan] is our destiny,» - answers  Yanukovych Junior. «This is our test. So we have to go through. <b>We have to serve the country, to save it from these idiots»</b></p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 13:30">13:30</span><p id="ten">Protesters are pushed back to Instytutska, a part of them moving towards Maidan and a part toward Kriposnyy lane. Some more people are standing behind the corner of Shovkovychna. Reinforcement comes to the security forces from Verkhovna Rada.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 13:43">13:43</span><p>The «Berkut» finally <b>takes control over the intersection of Shovkovychna and Instytutska.</b> They form the "testudo" shape structure from their shields, blocking the passage through Instytutska toward Lypska (to Maidan) and Kriposnyy Lane (to the Mariyinskyi park). After 10 minutes they also have a water cannon in place.</p>
        <p>Instytutska street was the only communication way in the government quarter which allowed the protesters to maneuver freely. Capturing the key intersection, <b>the security officers divided the participants of the morning demonstration</b> into two separate groups. The Self-Defense fighters, people most prepared for street clashes, are cut off from the Maidan.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="18 14:00">~14:00</span><p id="eleven">About <b>14:00</b> there are <b>clashes between the «Berkut» and the Self-Defense in the Kriposnyy lane.</b> This small street connects possible escape routes for participants of the march - Klovsky descent and Hrushevskoho (towards Arsenal).</p>
        <p>Around this time, a <b>57-year-old <span>Volodymyr KISCHUK </span> </b>— an entrepreneur from Dymer (Kyiv region) stops responding by phone. His was killed with a shot in the head near  Kriposnyy lane. </p>
        <p>Then a <b>44-year-old </b> security guard from Kyiv <b><span>Serhiy SHAPOVAL</span></b>, a fighter of the 21th Hundred of Maidan Self-Defense also died. Near the Kriposnyy lane he was shot with hunting canister shot, two pieces of lead pierced his stomach and heart.</p>
        <p> Around the same time as Shapoval dies <b><span>Ihor SERDYUK</span> (aged 44)</b>  — an entrepreneur from Kremenchuk.

        <p>«The peaceful  offensive» failed because <b>«Titushky» and security officers in the government quarter got ready to kill.</b>
        </p>
        <p>At least some of them will not hesitate to press the trigger or smash the skull of another person with an iron pipe. This was not true for the intellectuals and people from rural regions who participated in  <a class="dotted" href="http://texty.org.ua/pg/article/txts/read/67247/K_vecheru_vy_vse_umrete_Nacgvardijec_Myroslav" target="_blank">Maidan Self-Defense,</a> who attached  on the barricades near the House of Trade Unions a poster with a rhetorical appeal to their opponents, «TO  KILL AND THEN LIVE WITH IT?»</p>
        <p>So the <b>authorities again raised the stakes in the confrontation:</b> «We are ready not only to kill and maim, but to do it systematically, by dozens. And you?»</p>
        <p>The determination of authorities to use violence yielded impressive results. Subsequently, in a few hours Maidan lost its core defenders and all territorial achievements of the past 90 days, shrinking down to a small area around the stage.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon on February 18, few outside observers would doubt that the protest would last for only several hours. «That's the end», people wrote in social networks in despair.</p>
        <p>And at the moment of greatest triumph of the armed and trained policemen over defenseless civilians <b>Maidan accepts the price.</b></p>
        <p>According to the investigators of the GPU, from about 2 p.m. that day, <b>the gunshot wounds of officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were first documented.</b></p>
        <p>So <b>on the 90-th day of protest Maidan takes up arms,</b> while some protesters were shot with firearms a month ago.</p>

        <p>The «Party of Regions» invites Turchynov to negotiations with Yanukovych. The group of negotiators gets on foot to the Presidential Administration through the barricades, fire and smoke. On some blocked streets violent clashes continue.</p>
        <p>After five minutes’ hysterical debate with swearing and threats Yanukovych agrees to a compromise: MIA stops shooting and maiming, and protesters return to Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Turchynov calls to the Self-Defense commanders reporting about another cessation of hostilities.</p>
        <p> Two bodies in the House of Officers are Kischuk and Didych. The third is <b><span>Serhiy SHAPOVAL</span></b>.</p>
        <p> According to the General Prosecutor Office investigators, Kharkiv «Berkut» officer <b>Oleksandr Belov</b> was probably involved in the murder of Kischuk, Shapoval and Serdyuk. Traces of lead were found in the barrel of his «Fort».</p>
        <p>«FORT-500» is a smoothbore pump action shotgun produced in Ukraine, which was used by «Berkut».</p>
        <p>After the murders on January 22 the MIA always named this weapon the «specialized means to fire non-lethal ammunition.» This meant the rubber — in the MIA terminology «elastic» - bullets and canister shot (a large canister shot of 0.5-1 cm), placed in the 12-gauge cartridges.</p>
        <p>MIA does not add that the 12 mm gauge is standard for smoothbore guns. Their cartridges may use many types of ammunition. For example, hunting ammunition with lead bullet or canister.</p>

        <p>Some of the police did not sleep at all over those three days. Others slept for only a few hours. They slept right there on the asphalt and granite, on their shields. The protesters had some kind of rotation — the buses from the regions regularly broke through the checkpoints of the road police to Maidan.</p>
        <p id="fifty" style="margin-bottom:700px;">The Internal Troops also had little «ideological» motivation: people just dreamt about the end of that endless tour on duty. They wanted to survive and finally get home. Or at least to get to the bus of their platoon to sleep finally in a warm place.</p>

        <p>The first few dozens of protesters have already reached Instytutska and are under the pedestrian bridge. From the side of the Hotel Ukraina (former name — «Moscow») two water cannons appear — one grey, the other blue. The blue one, discharging water above people, starts watering people around the bridge. </p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 08:58">08:58</span><p>From the stage speakers an exclamation is heard for the first time: «Call a doctor!

        <p id="fifty-three">According to the results of the investigation, around this time about 25 fighters of a special police squadron got out of the bus which was parked near the Zhovtnevyy Palace. </p>
        <p>The unit came forward on the site. They wore stylish black uniforms without insignia. The officers were armed with AK-74 of 7.62 mm gauge. Each of the officers was wearing an identification sign — a yellow ribbon around the right sleeve.</p>
        <p>A farmer <b><span>Bohdan VAIDA</span> (aged 48)</b> from Lviv region was trying to keep on the side of the water cannons. He passed them to the right along the edge of Instytutska street.

        <p>Bohdan was collecting the autographs of Olympic Champions, and had a collection of about three thousand of them. For his hobby he received a medal from the International Olympic Committee. He took this award when he traveled to Maidan for the last time (apparently he planned to meet our Olympic Champions when they returned from the Winter Games in Sochi). After his death the medal was <a class="dotted" href="http://nebesna.pravda.com.ua/bogdan-vajda.html" target="_blank">not found</a>.</p>
        <p>The bullet of 7.62 mm hit Vaida in the head, and his relative identified the body by the hands. This type of ammunition is normally used with the Kalashnikov assault rifle. </p>
        <p>Until that moment the protesters were killed from smoothbore guns (mostly with canister shot). Vaida was the first protester shot with a bullet of 7.62 mm caliber fired from a rifle. Almost all subsequent fatal wounds that day the cause of which could be identified were caused by ammunition of that caliber.</p>
        <p>About the same time <b><span>Igor PECHENKO</span> (43),</b> a construction worker from Vyshgorod, was fatally wounded. </p>

        <p>Maksym was keen on medieval history. And during the first month of protests wore a knight’s helmet handmade by him to protect against the police clubs.

        <p>His brothers-in-arms seemingly fail to understand what happened. They do not turn around. They put the shields close and look forward. Behind them Ihor is lying on his side, bending and unbending knees.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:07</span><p>An armed man in the blue camouflage turns back to the wounded man. Suddenly he yanks his leg, like from a burn (another bullet may have hit nearly) and bolts back from a crouch start.</p>
        <p>Lying on his side, Dmytriv shoves off the pavement, as if trying to make a step towards the row where he was standing a few seconds ago. But this move only makes the body turn around on a slippery surface. One more tug towards the comrades, and he crouches down on the pavement in exhaustion.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:24</span><p>«The hunter» runs to Hotel Ukraina and slows down to striding on a path  along the hotel wall. This path is separated from Instytutska Street by a greenery spot from where he started his attack a couple of minutes ago.</p>
        <p>At this moment «the hunter» passes by <b><span>Andriy DYGDALOVYCH</span> (aged 40)</b>, a construction specialist from Lviv district. Andriy follows a parallel line, by a pavement along Instytutska Street, in the opposite direction, towards the bullets. </p>
        <p>Dygdalovych came to Kyiv three months ago. He arrived here to stand not for association with the EU, but rather for human dignity: «I want to tell the government that we won’t tolerate battering of our kids».  He was organizing the security in the Maidan headquarters, contributing to the Self-Defense. </p>
        <p>During all this period Dygdalovych had been at home twice, on Christmas and after getting injured at Hrushevskoho street. A traumatic missile hit him in the eye, destroying the sight by 80%. Andriy stayed in a Lviv hospital only a couple of days and returned to Kyiv, to his «Afghan Hundred».</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:32</span><p>The wounded Ihor Dmytriv is lying in the same position — on his side, with bent legs and his head on the ground. He is shivering, pressing his hand against the wound. The brothers-in-arms finally pay attention to his condition. </p>
        <p>Having got to the passage leading from Hotel Ukraina to the Instytutska Street, «the hunter» in blue camouflage slows down to usual walking speed. He firmly grabs at his rifle. At the pavement he turns left, to the descent leading to Maidan.  </p>
        <p>Andriy Dygdalovych continues walking up the street. He can be easily recognized by his athletic stature and almost 2 meters’ height. A huge wooden shield in his hands looks like a toy. His confident stare is that of a worldly-wise man used to make resolutions of his own and fulfill them.</p>
        <p>His only weapons are a self-made shield («plywood») and an armored vest («tin vest»).</p>
        <p>During the storm of December 11 Dygdalovych organized the defense. He stood in the first rank and was captured by the police during clashes. One of the police officers, who saw his cape with the words «Afghan veterans stand together with people» protected him from getting lynched.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:39</span><p>40 seconds passed since Ihor Dmytriv was shot. He does not move anymore, only the jacket on his back pouts and sags as he is struggling for breath.</p>
        <p>His comrades seem to have no clue what happened, or they just are disoriented. Who would have known anything about Kalashnikov wounds and tactical medicine back then?</p>
        <p>Andriy Dygdalovych covers the last several meters running.</p>
        <p>He is actually too young to have been an Afghan war veteran. He joined the veteran hundred because he considered that there he would be able to act in the most efficient way. The Afghan war veterans accepted him.</p>
        <span class="date" data-timestamp="20 09:22">09:22:42</span><p>Andriy takes a decision in a few seconds. Glimpsing at the wounded Ihor, he turns around and waves his hand to call others. Another person with a self-made shield, big enough to be used as a stretcher, responds and starts running up the street.</p>
        <p id="sixty-seven" style="margin-bottom:700px;">For his actions on December 11 Dygdalovych was presented for an award, honorable sign of the headquarters «For the Defense of Maidan».  The solemn awarding was planned for the morning of February 20.</p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>«Do not disappear, - the friends reminded Andriy two hours before, when he entered the headquarters tent after the night duty. — Your award ceremony is soon». «Am I a hero? — Dygdalovych answered then. «I did not deserve it. But I will deserve it now». He stood up and went out.</span></p>
        <p class="padded-multiline"><span>And here he is, on the Instytutska Street, organizing the evacuation of the wounded Ihor Dmytriv. He makes energetic gestures, giving some instructions to the three shield bearers.</span></p>
